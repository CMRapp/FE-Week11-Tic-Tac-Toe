# FE-Week11-Tic-Tac-Toe
Repository of Promineo Tech FE Developer Course Week 11 Programming. This week focuses on using JavaScript & Jquery. This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Star Wars theme.

# :information_source: About This Project
Jedi Battle is a Star Wars themed Tic Tac Toe game based on a program I originally created in C++ is 2009. Instead of traditional Xs & Os, I've used images. The Xs are represented by Yoda and the Os are 
represented by Vader. There are even sounds that are played. I hope you enjoy this project!

If you download the files, you will need to install Bootstrap and JQuery to run the program.
